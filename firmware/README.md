# Firware for BeebKBPS2

This folder contains the RP2040/Pico firmware for the project. 

# Build

The usual CMake build process for a Pico project should be followed. There are 
too many variations of SDK/IDE/Operating system for me to document here. 

If you just want to use the board and don't need to modify the firmware please
just download a release from the GitHub Releases page and copy to your Pico.
